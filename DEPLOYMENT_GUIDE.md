```

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: cPanel Hosting (Recommended for you)

Based on your preferences, here's how to deploy to cPanel:

1. **Access cPanel File Manager**
   - Log into your cPanel account
   - Open "File Manager"
   - Navigate to `public_html` directory

2. **Upload Files**
   - **Replace existing files**: Delete all contents in `public_html`
   - Upload ALL contents from the `out/` directory to `public_html`
   - Ensure the file structure is maintained

3. **Required Files for cPanel**
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── index.html
   ├── 404.html
   ├── _next/ (entire folder)
   ├── *.svg files
   └── favicon.ico
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify (Alternative)

1. **Drag & Drop Deployment**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag the entire `out/` folder to Netlify
   - Your site will be live instantly

2. **Custom Domain** (Optional)
   - Add your custom domain in Netlify settings
   - Configure DNS records as instructed

### Option 3: Vercel

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   cd out
   vercel --prod
   ```

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Before deployment, you need to configure:

1. **WalletConnect Project ID**
   - Get your project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
   - This is required for wallet connections to work

### For cPanel Deployment

Since this is a static build, environment variables are compiled into the build. If you need to change the WalletConnect Project ID:

1. **Update the environment variable**
   ```bash
   # In your local .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
   ```

2. **Rebuild and redeploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Then upload the new out/ folder contents to cPanel
   ```
