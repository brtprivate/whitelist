## Files to Upload
Upload all files from the 'cpanel-deploy' directory to your cPanel public_html directory.

## Steps:
1. Access your cPanel File Manager
2. Navigate to public_html directory
3. Upload all files from the 'cpanel-deploy' folder
4. Extract if uploaded as a zip file
5. Ensure all files are in the root of public_html (not in a subdirectory)

## Important Files:
- index.html (main entry point)
- _next/ (Next.js static assets)
- All other HTML files for routing

## Notes:
